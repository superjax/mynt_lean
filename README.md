This node has basically no configuration, it will display the left and right images if the `show_left` or `show_right` parameters are set to true, but otherwise it's as thin as possible.

It depends on the MYNT SDK submodule, be sure to run

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

after cloning
